    <h1 class="one"> Name - age - date of birth </h1>
  </p> My name is Hanan nanaa, 20 years old, I was born in Aleppo. I left my country in 2010 and I lived in Turkey for five years. In 2016 I moved to Canada with my parents, I went to high school then transferred to CALC an adult school in Toronto.
I spend most of my time working, studying and volunteering, me and other friends are running a self supporting Facebook group of newcomers students in Canada. We ask questions,
we chat and we share available opportunities so we got to know each other and do some activities, I write, read and swim during weekends and I am very satisfied that my time is full of  different activities. </p>

<p>  I work with Western University as a social media team leader & Coordinator. The team and I coordinate an online platform that foreign students are accessing to better understand
the registration process and student life at Western University. As well as we engage current Wester University students to participate in a cultural share program to
ease in the settlement of prospective and incoming students </p>

<p1> As I work online most of the time, I chose to work at Starbucks so I can stay connected with people.Talking to people and share same cup of coffee each morning make me feel happy and comfortable.</p1>
